# Anime's list 	ðŸ™‚

Web scraping with curl `curl` command will get raw data. Throughout the one-liner it gets cleaner until it achieves the Anime's names.

With this project I want to randomize those names and get one name randomly.

### Tasks I want to get done with this little project


- [x] Scrap names from a website 
- [x] Use `sed`, `awk` and `cut` to clean data
- [x] Use loops to get the number of pages that the website has
- [ ] Pick one name randomly
